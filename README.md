# Animatronic-Arm


Designed an animatronic twin control system that replicates a flex sensor-based wearable glove, capable of detecting even slight changes in resistance from subtle finger movements. Both a digital and mechanical twin systems were created which were able to mimic the motion of a user.

The system was designed with a focus on flexibility and durability to withstand repeated bending and flexing cycles. The goal was to create a reliable and responsive interface for enhanced motion tracking and control.
